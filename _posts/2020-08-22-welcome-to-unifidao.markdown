# UniFi DAO v1
## Universal Finance in the Cosmos Ecosystem

### Manifesto:
We will unify the Cosmos universise of blockchains and accelerate participation in the DeFi economy.

### Purpose of the DAO
To enable the community to easily and quickly coordinate the funding and delivery of interoperable solutions unique to the Cosmos universe.

### Goals
Successfully participate in and redefine "decentralized finance" in the Cosmos universe and greater blockchain ecosystem.

### Structure
The DAO is a collection of steering committees (defined by multisgnature keys) tasked to execute vote porposals submitted by the community. This website will host the proposals and the steering committees that will execute on approved proposals.

### Governance
Any member of the DAO may propose a vote with a steering committee to fulfill the vote results. Votes are tallied in ATOMs. The DAO governance is meant to support the other governance structures of the blockchains in the Cosmos universe.

### DAO Source of Funds
We propose a simple financing structure for the DAO as follows:

* Free Membership for anyone to participate in the UniFi DAO
* UniFi DAO proposals may be submitted for vote with a minimum ATOM requirement of funding the proposal
* Proposals will be voted in by ATOM payments to a DAO multisig address provided by the UniFi DAO steering committee for that proposal
* A Proposal vote success will be measured by ATOM deposit to the proposal minimum ATOM requirements
* Proposal vote failures will see funds returned to voting addresses from the multisig wallet.
